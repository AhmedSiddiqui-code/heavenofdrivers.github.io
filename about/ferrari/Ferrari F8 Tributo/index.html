    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      Lithe and voluptuous, the 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo is the supercar to choose if you like your automotive performance packaged in an undeniably glamorous wrapper—and who doesn't? With its chiseled panels and windblown profile, the F8 Tributo looks more beautiful than brash, which sets it apart from other cars in Ferrari's stable. This coupe is new to the Ferrari lineup for the 2020 model year, stepping in to replace the outgoing 488GTB. Memorably quick off the line, the F8 Tributo is motivated by the same burly 710-hp V-8 that lives under the hood of the 488 Pista. This alluring coupe costs more than an Ivy League education, but its price is justified by its winning style and breathtaking performance.

    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, & PERFORMANCE</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      The F8 Tributo is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V-8 that produces 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. All models are rear-wheel drive, and a seven-speed automatic transmission changes the gears. This Ferrari is quick enough to make an indelible impression. We estimate that it's capable of sprinting from a standstill to 60 mph in about 2.8 seconds. Handling is precise and rewarding. The F8 Tributo's engine hits a pleasantly sonorous note as it does its work, and the brakes do a masterful job of bringing this coupe to a swift halt.

    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">INTERIOR, COMFORT, & CARGO</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      The F8 Tributo provides seating for two passengers within a cabin that's roomy enough to provide pleasant, comfortable accommodations. Contrasting stitching and sporty design cues help give the interior a performance-themed aesthetic that matches that of the car's sheetmetal. The cabin's most notable shortcoming concerns rearward visibility. The view out the back is impeded by the rear window's louvers. Many exotics are very low on cargo space, and the F8 Tributo is no exception. Cargo capacity stands at seven cubic feet.

    <h1 >FUEL ECONOMY AND REAL-WORLD MPG</h1>
    <p  >
      Fuel economy for the 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo stands at 15/19 mpg city/highway, according to EPA estimates. That's better mileage than you'll get with rivals such as the Lamborghini Huracán (up to 13/18 mpg).
