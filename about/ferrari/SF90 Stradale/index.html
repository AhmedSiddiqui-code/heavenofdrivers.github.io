    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      Electrified transportation is the way of the future. Ferrari gets on board by rolling out the SF90 Stradale, a plug-in hybrid with sleek styling, blistering performance, and a gas/electric powertrain. The brand's new hypercar comes standard with all-wheel drive and is capable of traveling for up to 16 miles using only electric power. The SF90 Stradale is motivated by three electric motors and a potent V-8, and they combine to produce a staggering 986 horsepower. Serious power means seriously quick acceleration; Ferrari claims this coupe sprints from zero to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds. The SF90 Stradale is priced at more than $600,000. If you have the resources, this car has what it takes to truly excite.

    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      With the SF90 Stradale, power comes from a massive V-8 and three electric motors. The 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 generates a mighty 769 horsepower on its own, and the trio of electric motors provide an additional 217 horsepower. In the end, the gas/electric powertrain generates a net output of 986 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels, making this the first mid-engined Ferrari with all-wheel drive. An eight-speed automatic transmission oversees the proceedings. As you'd expect, all that power under the hood translates into blistering acceleration. Ferrari estimates that this coupe will rocket from zero to 60 mph in a scant 2.5 seconds. Different driving modes allow you to tailor the car's handling to suit your preferences. The lineup includes EV Only, Hybrid, Performance, and, last but not least, Qualify—a setting that allows you to fully exploit the car's performance capabilities.

    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      The SF90 Stradale's interior is fairly sedate, with the yellow prancing-horse logo adding a splash of color on the center of the steering wheel. This two-seat coupe is home to a sculpted dashboard with fluid lines that mimic the flowing design of the car's exterior. With high-performance exotics, cargo space is typically in short supply. This is certainly the case with the SF90 Stradale, which provides roughly three cubic feet of room for your stuff.
