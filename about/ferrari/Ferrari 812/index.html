    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      The 2020 Ferrari 812 Superfast is an example of what happens when an automaker commits to crafting a vehicle that offers the best performance money can buy. With almost 800 horses under the hood, this coupe provides brutish power, facilitating a zero-to-60-mph sprint that clocks in at less than three seconds. There's also a certain practicality at play, since the 812 Superfast offers more cargo space than the typical supercar—enough to make it a reasonably accommodating choice for daily commutes. Fuel economy is poor, and the 812 Superfast's $330,000-plus price makes it accessible only to the very privileged few. Still, if you have deep pockets and a thirst for spectacular handling, this skilled Ferrari won't disappoint.

    <h1 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1000">ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, & PERFORMANCE</h1>
    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      Ferrari's 812 Superfast gets its muscle from a 6.5-liter V-12 powerplant, and this engine delivers a bracing 788 horsepower and 529 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear wheels. The 812 Superfast holds a place among the quickest of the quick. In our track tests, it sprinted from zero to 60 mph in a scant 2.8 seconds. That's a dazzling performance, but it trails that of the McLaren 720S. That car made the run in just 2.7 seconds. Handling is nimble, especially when you consider this Ferrari's relatively hefty curb weight. The engine note is mellifluous, and the car's brakes are potent enough to bring this beast to a quick and decisive standstill.

    <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="1500">
      The 812 Superfast provides seating for two. It's common for supercars to be blighted with a cramped cabin, but that's not the case with this Ferrari. Its interior offers reasonably spacious accommodations, good ergonomics, and modern design. There's also more cargo space than you typically find with high-performance sports cars. The Ferrari 812 Superfast provides 18 cubic feet of cargo volume, and this gives it enough room to capably accommodate your belongings during daily driving—and maybe even on a road trip—if you pack judiciously.
