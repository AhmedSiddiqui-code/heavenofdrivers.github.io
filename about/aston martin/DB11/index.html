      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Beyond its unmistakably British branding and endless James Bond references, Aston Martin has a reputation for building fast and fabulous sports cars such as the 2020 DB11. Not only does the 2+2 grand tourer catch the eye and trigger dopamine releases, it's available with a pair of twin-turbocharged engines that sound fantastic and go like stink. While the twin-turbo V-12 is only available on the track-oriented AMR model, both the regular coupe and Volante convertible benefit from a velvety twin-turbo V-8. Topless or not, the Aston's cabin is beautiful and extremely customizable. The 2020 DB11 also transitions from swanky boulevard cruiser to corner-carving terror at the driver's desire.

      <h1 data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="1000">Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>
      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        The DB11 offers two very distinct engine choices: a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 or a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V-12. The former develops 503 horsepower and 498 lb-ft of torque while the latter produces 630 ponies and 516 lb-ft. Both pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission that transmits all that power to the rear wheels. We've only tested a detuned version of the V-12 DB11 that made 600 horsepower and showed serious quickness, but Aston has abandoned the V-12 on non-AMR models. However, we most recently drove the DB11 AMR in northern Germany. There its massive thrust and athletic moves combined with an exhaust note that was equally melodic and menacing. We've also driven but haven't track-tested both V-8 versions. The DB11 coupe proved that fewer cylinders can be similarly quick and sound just as badass. Likewise, the drop-top DB11 Volante we drove was a stunning way to experience the south of France. While it's not available with the V-12, the Volante thankfully doesn't sacrifice performance.

      <p   data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        As expected, the inside of every DB11 is a plush environment that can be customized with fanciful leather colors and exotic materials. However, we've noticed some inconsistent panel fitment and surprisingly cheap-feeling switchgear. Still, these issues are minor compared with the otherwise extravagant and heart-pounding experience. Every model includes leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable front seats, and passive entry. Those who want more upscale features can add a heated steering wheel and ventilated front seats. Unfortunately, there are not many places to store small items inside the DB11 outside of the center-console bin that slides open to reveal cupholders and a useful tray.
