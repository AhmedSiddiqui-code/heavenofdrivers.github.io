    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>
      Rolls-Royce is widely recognized as an ultraluxurious coachbuilder for ultrawealthy folks, and the grandiose Ghost represents the entry point into that esteemed crowd. While the current Series II generation has been around for a while, based on recent spy shots, we expect an all-new Ghost will soon be revealed. We can tell the Ghost's styling will be an evolution, rather than a dramatic departure. However, the latest Ghost will most likely no longer share its underpinnings with the more mainstream BMW 7-series. Instead, expect Rolls to drop the Ghost's colossal shell and sumptuous cabin on top of an underlying structure of its own. Until more details are made public, we can only speculate on the future and report that the current model is still an incredible mode of transportation.

    <h1>Engines, Ride, and Handling</h1>
    <p>
      The upcoming Ghost should receive a similar engine, albeit more powerful than the one found under the hood of other Rolls-Royce products, such as the range-topping Phantom and the Cullinan SUV. Both feature a twin-turbocharged 6.7-liter V-12 that makes 563 horsepower and up to 664 lb-ft of torque. The Ghost Series II is put in motion by a twin-turbo 6.6-liter V-12 engine that makes 563 horses and 605 lb-ft of torque. However, Black Badge models make another 40 ponies and 15 lb-ft; Rolls claims a governed top speed of 155 mph for every version. The last one we tested was less powerful, but it still managed to move with authority in a straight line—even though it was rather listless going around corners.

    <h1>Interior and Technology</h1>
    <p>
      To enter the cavernous back seat on the current Ghost Series II, have your personal assistant open the rear-hinged door. Spy photos of the new model show abutting door handles, which guarantee that it will continue to use the suicide-door setup. We also expect the next Ghost's interior environment to be as plush or plusher than that of the current model. Available with a short or long wheelbase, the Series II is primarily used to transport the one-percenters to and from five-star hotels and red-carpet galas. Meanwhile, they are given ample spread-out space and treated to some of the finest materials on the planet.
