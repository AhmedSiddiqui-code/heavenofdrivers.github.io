    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p  >
      The Phantom is not only the ultimate status symbol, it's the Holy Grail of handcrafted luxury automobiles. Its decadent design is derived from an aluminum structure that rides atop an air suspension for euphoric comfort. Want to show the world you've arrived? You need a Phantom.

    <h1>Engines, Ride, and Handling</h1>
    <p>
      Prodigious power is provided by a 563-hp twin-turbo V-12 paired with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk, but Rolls-Royce's claimed 5.1-second zero-to-60-mph time isn't anything you'd appreciate your chauffer trying to replicate; the Phantom is better suited for wafting along with smooth, steady inputs to throttle and steering. To say that the ride is smooth would be an understatement: The Phantom practically levitates over the road and features a pothole-spotting camera that helps the suspension adapt to road imperfections in real time.

    <h1>Interior and Technology</h1>
    <p>
        An interior tailored for kings can even be adorned with a custom-artwork dash. Acres of wood, real metal accents, and vast expanses of fine leather cover nearly every square inch of the cabin. Rolls-Royce offers both a standard- and long-wheelbase version of the Phantom, with the latter being 8.6 inches longer, much of which is offered as additional rear-seat legroom. Rear-hinged coach doors open to allow graceful ingress and egress to the rear seat where passengers can be treated to a myriad of luxuries such as deep-pile carpeted floor mats, power-adjustable seats with massage, a refrigerated console compartment, and remote controls for the car's infotainment system. Its dizzying array of optional tech includes night vision and a distinct laser-light system, but Rolls-Royce also offers more mundane driver-assistance features such as forward collision and lane-departure warning as standard.
