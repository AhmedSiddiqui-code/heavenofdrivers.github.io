      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Whether you're a hip-hop icon or simply a fan of tasteful splendor, the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL-class still radiates status and elegant curb appeal. Though the current generation of Mercedes-Benz's longest-running nameplate has aged, albeit gracefully, its comfortable cabin and enthusiastic driving traits create an honest and sporty luxury roadster. Sufficient motivation is delivered by a 362-hp V-6 or the hearty 449 horsepower of the twin-turbocharged V-8. With the retractable hard top stowed, the SL-class feels at home on curving roads or just cruising a country two-lane feeling a summer breeze on your face. Executing a sensual blend of luxury and sport has always been a Mercedes forte, and the SL-class maintains that tradition.

      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Whether you choose the SL450's turbo V-6 or the SL550's turbo V-8, you'll enjoy effortless power and refined performance. Of course, with the V-8, you'll get more of that effortless power. Even if the 362-hp SL450 is not the quickest SL model, its acceleration is snappy and satisfying—it reaches 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, fast by any measure—with crisp responses from the nine-speed automatic transmission. We love the V-6's exhaust note, too, and its performance is good enough to make the significantly more expensive SL550, with its extra 87 horsepower, seem unnecessary. The SL is not as agile as true sports cars such as the Porsche 911, but it's still fun to drive quickly. The well-weighted steering is precise and satisfying, and the adjustable suspension firms up nicely in the Sport and Sport+ driving modes. Leave it in Comfort mode for a mostly cushy ride quality, although some harsh impacts from the road enter the cabin, owing to the large wheels and low-profile tires.

      <h1  data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="1000">Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h1>
      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Plush, well assembled, and easy to use, the SL's cabin is a pleasant place for two—even if it doesn't feel quite as special as that of some of the newer models from Mercedes-Benz. The front seats are mounted low, as you'd expect in a sporty two-door, but it's reasonably easy to get into and out of them. They're highly adjustable, comfortable, and have plenty of space. With standard leather upholstery and a variety of wood, aluminum, and carbon-fiber trims to choose from, the SL's interior is dressy enough to match your finest attire for a night out on the town. The folded hardtop takes up a significant amount of space in the cargo area, so you'll have to pack carefully if you plan on road tripping with the top down. A movable partition blocks the part of the cargo area that the top occupies so that it doesn't crush your luggage when you decide to enjoy the sunshine. Speaking of luggage, the SL's trunk will fit just two carry-on suitcases—pack accordingly.
