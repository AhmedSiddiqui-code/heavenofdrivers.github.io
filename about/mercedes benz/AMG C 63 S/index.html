        It's getting harder to find a car in the compact-luxury class with ridiculous levels of performance. So we should all be happy for the existence of the 2020 Mercedes-AMG C63, the hot-rod version of the Mercedes-Benz C-class. It's available as a sedan, coupe, or convertible, and every one of them comes with a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine hand-built by engineers in Affalterbach, Germany. The regular C63 makes 469 horsepower, while the C63 S is tuned to make 503 hp. Either way, this car gathers speed in gobs and promises to bring excitement to your humdrum commute. We could do without the harsh ride, but the C63 is so much fun you might not care.

        The 2020 Mercedes-AMG C63 and C63 S have a hand-built, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine. In the C63, it makes 469 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. The C63 S ups the performance ante with 503 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic with rear-wheel drive. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph on the regular C63 and 180 mph on the S. In our testing, the C63 S went from zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and ripped through the quarter-mile in 11.9 seconds at 122 mph; we haven't tested a C63. In Lightning Lap 2019, a C63 S coupe turned in a 2:57.1 lap, which puts it right behind the discontinued Cadillac CTS-Von our all-time list. All C63s come standard with an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential and an AMG Ride Control suspension with adaptive dampers. Dynamic engine mounts are included on C63 S variants. Handling is excellent. Equipped with summer tires, the C63 S managed 1.02 g's of lateral acceleration on our skidpad and braked from 70 mph to a stop in just 157 feet. This capability comes at the price of comfort, as the ride is harsh over rough pavement.

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Black faux-leather/microfiber upholstery is standard in the regular-strength C63, while the S models have leather seats. Both versions get a choice of wood and aluminum interior accents. We're big fans of the available AMG Performance seats, which have a ventilation feature. Although you can load up on technology in the cockpit, this is an elegant car at heart, and both the materials and the ambience are in keeping with the high asking price. The C63 sedan has a 12.6-cubic-foot trunk, while the coupe has a smaller 10.5-cubic-foot cargo hold. Both have a 40/20/40-split folding rear seat. The C63 cabriolet has a standard power-operated soft top (available in four colors) and offers 8.8 cubic feet of cargo space when the top is up. Its rear seats fold in a 50/50 split.
