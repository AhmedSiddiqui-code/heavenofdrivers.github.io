      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Created by AMG, the in-house speed shop of Mercedes, the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT and GT C are the luxury brand's answer to the Porsche 911, while the track-focused GT R and GT R Pro rival the Porsche 911 GT3 and GT3 RS. The two-seat sports cars are offered as a coupe or soft-top roadster and serve as the halo sports cars to the Mercedes-AMG lineup. Gorgeously curvaceous and brutally quick, with zero-to-60-mph times of less than 3.5 seconds, all are front-engine, rear-wheel-drive machines powered by a thunderous turbocharged V-8 with considerable might. A dual-clutch seven-speed automatic transmission is standard. With grip surpassing 1.0 g, these are hard-core performance machines, but the GT and GT C models also offer everyday civility.

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Every 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT, GT C, and GT R is powered by a 4.0-liter V-8. Every model also gets a carbon-fiber driveshaft and a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic transaxle, which improves balance and handling. The engine is a technological tour de force, with dry-sump oiling, direct injection, and two turbochargers. It's rated to produce 469 horsepower in the GT models, but it's cranked up to 550 horsepower in the GT C variants and 577 horsepower in the GT R and GT R Pro, which also get an aerodynamics package that increases downforce by 220 pounds at 155 mph versus the standard GT R, improving grip and performance on the racetrack. When driven by Mercedes-AMG factory driver Maro Engel, Mercedes says the GT R Pro laps the Nürburgring Nordschleife six seconds faster than the standard GT R. Buyers should be aware, however, that the 443-hp 2020 Porsche 911 S is quicker than the Mercedes, hitting 60 mph in 3.0 seconds.

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        Mercedes has successfully updated the interior of its sports car for 2020, adding technology and function. Overall build quality remains superior, and the cabin materials are in line with the GT's big sticker price. It's not very roomy inside, but the driving position is perfect, and seat comfort is exceptional. The new 12.3-inch configurable instrument display is a welcome change along with its new, larger 10.3-inch central infotainment screen. Ergonomics are also improved by the revised center console, with capacitive-touch controls for the car's many performance settings. And as with Porsche, Mercedes has moved the GT's drive-mode selector dial to the steering wheel where it should be. Roadsters get a power top that drops in seconds. With 10.1 cubic feet of cargo space, the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT's trunk is twice as large as the Porsche 911's.
