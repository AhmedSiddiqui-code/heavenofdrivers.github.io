      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        The 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-class has long been a shining example of what luxury should be, largely due to its sumptuous looks and impressive performance. Whether you choose the spacious sedan, dignified coupe, or lavish convertible, these top-shelf Benzes are chock full with the latest technology and the finest of materials. The S-class has it all: an interior that could please a sultan, performance to please a hot shoe, and a road presence that is unmistakably majestic. It may be expensive, but if you're shopping in this segment, you'll be happy to know that you're getting every last bit of your money's worth.

      <h1 data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="1000">Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>
      <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        The S-class sedan is available with one of two gasoline powertrains: a 362-hp twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and a 463-hp twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8. The former is sold with S450 badges, and the latter wears S560 on its trunklid. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive can be ordered with either engine. We clocked a rear-wheel-drive 2018 S450 at 5.3 seconds in our zero-to-60-mph test; the 2018 S560 did the deed in 4.2 seconds. The coupe and cabriolet come only with the V-8 and the 2018 S560 coupe managed a brisk 4.0-second zero-to-60-mph run at our test track. If these numbers aren't exciting enough for you, the Mercedes-AMG lineup of S-classes (reviewed separately) are even quicker. We haven't tested the 560e, but we expect that it will be slightly quicker than the standard twin-turbo V-6 models.

      <p   data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
        There are precious few automotive interiors we'd rather be in than that of the S-class. The cabin is contemporary and overtly luxurious. Buyers can choose from a host of leathers, woods, and intricate stitching accents for the seats, door panels, and dashboard, as well as power actuation for the rear seats and massage functions for the front and outboard rear chairs. The interior even smells decadent, thanks to the climate control's integrated air-perfuming system. As with many of its competitors, the S-class has a smaller trunk than you might imagine and doesn't have a folding back seat to open up extra cargo room. We managed to fit five of our carry-on suitcases inside the trunk of both the sedan and the coupe. If you'll need more cargo capacity, we'd suggest taking a look at the Lincoln Continental, the Volvo S90 or the Cadillac XTS, all of which held more carry-ons and can be had with a folding rear seat.
