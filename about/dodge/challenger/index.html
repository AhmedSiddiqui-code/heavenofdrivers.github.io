              The 2020 Dodge Challenger is like a vehicular time machine, with bold styling and raucous sounds that recall muscle cars from the 60s and 70s. While its outward appearance and unmistakable soundtrack are the epitome of nostalgia, this two-door coupe is available with modern features galore and serious performance hardware. A pair of potent V-8 engines and an enhanced widebody kit cater to enthusiasts. A V-6 model with optional all-wheel drive allows buyers on a budget to enjoy the big-bodied Dodge in all four seasons. The 2020 Challenger doesn't have the precise handling of the Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang, but it has a roomier cabin and a bigger trunk that make it much friendlier for daily driving. Those who prioritize power above everything else should check out the 700-hp-plus SRT Hellcat.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            Dodge does its best to keep the aging Challenger up to date for 2020 with a smattering of superficial updates. These include nine new wheel designs and finishes, more paint-color options, some fresh exterior badges, and a limited-production 50th Anniversary Edition. The latter is available on all but the base model, and it brings exclusive exterior treatments such as a body-color shaker hood and hand-painted black body panels—among other improvements. Inside, the special edition gets 50th Anniversary badges throughout as well as nappa leather with faux-suede accents and contrast stitching. The interior of the regular Challenger is also spruced up with more color options, a different flat-bottom steering wheel on select models, and more premium-looking material options on Challengers with leather upholstery.

            The Challenger's base 305-hp V-6 won't satisfy thrill seekers. The modest engine mates exclusively to the eight-speed automatic, but in the heavy Challenger it lacks the acceleration and excitement of similar rivals. The Dodge's Hemi V-8 engines are another story. The 375-hp 5.7-liter we tested had plenty of juice to powerslide on demand, and its guttural growl was gratifying. Those seeking to maximize the Challenger's potential will want the 6.4-liter V-8, which produces 485 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque. We also drove the T/A 392 with the automatic and admired the exhaust's cannon-blast startup sound and baritone roar when prodded. While we're suckers for the shift-yourself stick, the ZF automatic is incredibly responsive to throttle inputs, with quick power-on downshifts. The Challenger hustles through corners like a raging bull seeing red, snorting aggressively and swaying threateningly. The burly Dodge is a muscle car in the truest sense: it's better on the street and the drag strip than on two-lane roads or road courses. The models we've driven since the lineup was redesigned for 2015 have had compliant rides that are comfortable but a bit unrefined. Compared with the sharper and stickier handling of the Camaro and Mustang, however, the Challenger is too soft in the twisties and its steering is too numb.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The Challenger has a classic muscle-car interior, with a simple design inspired by its 1970s-era predecessors and comfortable accommodations. Compared with its pony-car rivals, the Dodge is far roomier inside and adults can actually use the back seat. Unfortunately, its rubberized materials resemble old vinyl rather than premium plastic, and its rear visibility is lousy. The Challenger's broad front seats are comfortable for cruising, but even the optional seats, which have added bolstering, don't hug their occupants the way those in the Camaro or Mustang do. Dodge's pony car has an extra seven cubic feet of cargo space in its trunk versus the Camaro. This allowed the Challenger to swallow two additional bags of luggage with the back seat in use and six more than the Camaro with it folded down. The Challenger has a big center-console bin and a useful spot for a smartphone. Still, none of the cars we tested in this class were particularly adept at storing small items.
