          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The 2020 Dodge Charger is the choice for buyers that want or need a full-size sedan but prefer not to compromise on performance or practicality. It's precisely these qualities that have made the Charger lineup so successful over the years. Additionally, the Charger is the only vehicle in its segment with rear-wheel drive and not one, but two, throaty V-8 engines. All models share an excellent eight-speed automatic transmission, but only the V-6 model can be had with optional all-wheel drive. While the Charger lacks some of its competitors' richer interior materials, it makes up for this shortcoming with a superb infotainment system and an engaging driving experience. Between its lively palette of color options and nostalgia-inspiring decals, the Charger is an affordable-performance proposition that's hard to resist.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            For 2020, Dodge's Widebody package is now an option on the Scat Pack; widebody cars also receive unique front and rear bumper designs. Scat Pack Chargers with the Widebody package come standard with three-mode adaptive Bilstein dampers. Opting for the Widebody package also carries over the brakes and rotors from the Hellcat and 20- x 11-inch wheels wrapped with wider tires. Throughout the lineup, Dodge has added myriad wheel options, with names such as Devil's Rim and Warp Speed, and Brass Monkey. Buyers looking to further customize the looks of their Charger can opt for the Satin Black Appearance package that covers the hood, roof, decklid, and spoiler. For those wanting to spruce up the interior, Dodge is now offering a Carbon and Suede package that adds real carbon-fiber accents to the instrument panel and console, as well as the addition of faux suede to the headliner, visors, and front roof pillars. Rounding out changes for 2020 are three new paint colors: Frostbite, Hellraisin, and Sinamon.

            The Charger channels its NASCAR roots with big V-8 power and rowdy sounds. However, not every Charger has a mighty Hemi V-8 under the hood—what a pity—but they do all share an excellent eight-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel drive. In contrast, the V-6 is rather subdued but does add the availability of all-wheel drive. Dodge doesn't build a Charger with a manual gearbox, but it would be so much cooler if it did. The standard V-6 is no slouch, yet it lacks the giddy-up of front-drivers such as the Nissan Maxima and the Buick LaCrosse. The more powerful versions excel at the strip, where the 485-hp Charger R/T Scat Pack posted an impressive 4.1-second sprint to 60 mph. The 370-hp Charger has enough ponies to outrun most family sedans.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The Charger's interior is highly functional yet the opposite of luxurious, with more rubberized materials than the set of an adult film. Apart from excellent rear-seat legroom, its passenger space is slightly below average. The cabin's simplistic design is classic muscle car, but options are plentiful.
            Although its trunk volume is similar to those of most rivals, the Charger was able to fit an extra carry-on box than its rivals. It held 18 total with the rear seat stowed, beating the Maxima and the fastback-hatchback Kia Stinger by three. Its center console features plenty of spots for small items and a slot alongside the shifter that is perfect for storing your smartphone.
