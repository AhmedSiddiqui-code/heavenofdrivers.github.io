            The 2020 Dodge Journey is hands-down the cheapest three-row SUV you can buy today. Despite a design that is showing its age and features that are increasingly outdated, it undercuts the pricing of its competitors by thousands. Despite the Journey's sloppy driving dynamics, sluggish powertrain, and lack of driver-assistance technologies, the fact that it has a configurable cabin and a user-friendly infotainment system should appeal to price-conscious buyers.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            Dodge cuts down the number of available trims on the Journey from three to just two for 2020: the SE Value and the Crossroad. The other notable cuts are the absence of all-wheel drive and the optional V-6 engine that were paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. The only powertrain available is now the antiquated 172-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder that is paired to a four-speed automatic and front-wheel drive. Buyers can look forward to the addition of standard rear park assist to all models as well as a standard sunroof for the Crossroad trim level. Dodge also streamlines the option-picking process with the introduction of the Popular Equipment Group which bundles many features together, depending on trim level. In the SE Value trim, the package gives you a six-way power-adjustable driver's seat, Uconnect with Voice Command and Bluetooth, SiriusXM satellite radio, three-zone climate control, security alarm, and a leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel. The Crossroad's Popular Equipment Group adds a universal garage door opener, remote start, heated front seats and steering wheel, navigation, and a six-speaker sound system with a subwoofer.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The Journey SE and Crossroad trims come with an underpowered four-cylinder engine that's best avoided—except you can't, since the V-6 is no longer offered. The 172-hp engine is woefully underpowered and the four-speed automatic transmission that's reluctant to downshift further dulls its real-world performance.
            There are not many three-row crossovers that are entertaining to drive, so their ride and handling are graded on a curve. Even so, the Journey's ponderous handling and unresponsive transmission leave it far from getting a good rating from us. It wallows in corners with lots of body roll and imprecise steering. The benefit of this softness, however, is a comfortable ride on the freeway.

          <p  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The Journey's interior is far from upscale, but its simple controls are user-friendly. Getting anyone to fit in the third row—even children—requires those in the second row to compromise their legroom. Cheap-feeling bits such as a plasticky shifter and hollow-sounding interior door-trim panels are especially egregious on the priciest version. Several luxury features including a power-adjustable passenger seat, cooled seats, and heated rear seats are notable in their absence from the options list.
